# Unhandled Async Errors in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate handling of errors within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, where a potential error in an asynchronous function is not handled effectively, leading to instability. The solution, presented in `bugSolution.js`, provides a more robust error handling mechanism. 

## Problem

The initial code uses `.then()` and `.catch()` for asynchronous operations, but the error handling in the `.catch()` block is minimal.  A production application requires more sophisticated error handling to prevent crashes and provide informative feedback to users.

## Solution

The improved code uses more comprehensive error handling.  It logs errors to the console for debugging and sends appropriate HTTP status codes to clients, indicating failure.  It also handles various types of errors that might occur.
